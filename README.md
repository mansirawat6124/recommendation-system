# description

This code implements a simple recommendation system using matrix factorization in PyTorch. It defines a Recommender model that learns embeddings for users and items, then predicts ratings by computing the dot product of these embeddings. A sample user-item interaction is tested by predicting a rating for a specific user and item. The model can be trained using an optimization algorithm like SGD with a loss function such as MSELoss to improve its recommendations.
